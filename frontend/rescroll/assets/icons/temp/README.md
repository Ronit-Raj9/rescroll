# AI-Generated Icons Implementation

## Overview
This project updates the ReScroll app with new AI-generated icons for the bottom tab navigation. The implementation includes:

1. Icon specification and generation guidelines
2. An icon preview component to visualize the icons
3. Integration with the existing app tab navigation

## Files Created

### Documentation
- `frontend/rescroll/assets/icons/temp/icon_guide.md` - Detailed specifications for each icon
- `frontend/rescroll/assets/icons/temp/generate_icons.md` - Step-by-step guide for generating and implementing icons
- `frontend/rescroll/assets/icons/temp/test_icons.sh` - Script to test the app with new icons
- `frontend/rescroll/assets/icons/temp/README.md` - This file, summarizing the implementation

### Code
- `frontend/rescroll/components/IconPreview.tsx` - Component to preview all icons in various states
- `frontend/rescroll/app/icon-preview.tsx` - Screen to display the icon preview component

### Temporary Placeholder Icons
Created temporary placeholder icons using existing app icons:
- `frontend/rescroll/assets/icons/ai-search.png` - Using magnifying_glass.png temporarily
- `frontend/rescroll/assets/icons/ai-top-papers.png` - Using document.png temporarily
- `frontend/rescroll/assets/icons/ai-bookmarks.png` - Using bookmark.png temporarily
- `frontend/rescroll/assets/icons/ai-explore.png` - Using safari.png temporarily

These placeholder icons will work until they are replaced with the AI-generated versions.

## How to View Icon Preview
After generating and placing the AI icons, you can view them in the preview screen:

```bash
# Navigate to your app directory
cd frontend/rescroll

# Run the app
npx expo start
```

Then navigate to `/icon-preview` in the app to see all icons in various states.

## Next Steps
1. Generate the AI icons using the guidelines in `icon_guide.md`
2. Replace the placeholder icons with your AI-generated ones
3. Run the app and navigate to the icon preview screen to verify their appearance
4. Test the app with the new icons in the tab navigation
5. Commit the changes once satisfied

## Tab Navigation Integration
The icons are already integrated into the tab navigation in `frontend/rescroll/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`. No code changes are needed; simply replace the placeholder icon files with your generated ones.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter an "Empty file" error, it means an icon file exists but has no content. Make sure all icon files contain valid PNG data.
